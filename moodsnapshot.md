Understood! Consolidating all the information into a single Markdown (`.md`) file is a great way to provide a comprehensive and easily readable document to your developer.

I will now generate the complete Markdown file, incorporating the updated project document for the web app, the Privacy Policy, and the Terms of Service. I've replaced `[Your Company Name/Your Name]` with "Connected Spaces" and added a placeholder for your contact email.

Here is the content for your `mood_snapshot_project_document.md` file:

# Mood Snapshot - Project Document (Version 1 - Web App)

## 1. Introduction

*   **Project Name:** Mood Snapshot
*   **Brief Overview:** Mood Snapshot is a **web application** designed to help users effortlessly track their daily moods, gain insights into their emotional patterns, and identify potential triggers. Version 1 of the app will be entirely free, focusing on building a strong user base through its simplicity, intuitiveness, and immediate value, accessible directly via a web browser.
*   **Project Goal:** To provide users with a minimalist, intuitive, and highly effective tool for self-awareness regarding their emotional well-being, fostering positive habits through effortless daily check-ins and insightful data visualization. The primary goal for V1 is user adoption and engagement through web accessibility.

## 2. Target Audience

*   Individuals interested in improving their mental well-being and self-awareness.
*   Users who find traditional journaling or complex mood trackers overwhelming.
*   Anyone seeking a quick, private, and accessible way to monitor their emotional state over time, without needing to download an app from an app store.
*   Users who appreciate clean, minimalist web app design.

## 3. Key Features (Version 1 - All Free)

Version 1 of Mood Snapshot will include the following core functionalities, all available for free:

*   **3.1. Effortless Mood Logging:**
    *   Users can quickly log their current mood with a single tap using an intuitive visual scale (emojis or colors).
    *   Designed for speed and minimal friction in daily use.
*   **3.2. Insightful Trend Analysis:**
    *   Provides a historical overview of logged moods via a calendar view.
    *   Displays basic graphs (line, bar) to visualize mood trends over selected timeframes (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
*   **3.3. Smart Trigger Identification (Basic):**
    *   Allows users to add short, custom tags to their mood entries (e.g., #workstress, #goodsleep).
    *   Shows basic correlations between tags and associated moods (e.g., which tags frequently appear with certain mood states).
*   **3.4. Personalized Growth & Well-being (Basic):**
    *   Users can customize the labels and colors of their mood scale.
    *   Ability to export personal mood data (e.g., CSV) for personal review or sharing with professionals.
*   **3.5. Gentle Reminders:**
    *   Users can set simple, customizable daily reminders. (Note: Web push notifications for reminders can be less reliable than native app notifications and require user permission within the browser.)

## 4. UI/UX Design & Flow

The design philosophy for Mood Snapshot V1 is **minimalism, intuitiveness, and speed**. The app should feel effortless, visually appealing, and provide immediate value.

*   **4.1. General Design Principles:**
    *   **Clean & Uncluttered:** Minimal UI elements, ample whitespace.
    *   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear icons, logical flow, minimal taps to achieve tasks.
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Subtle animations or highlights for interactions.
    *   **Color Palette:** Calming and consistent, potentially using colors that subtly reflect mood states.
    *   **Typography:** Legible and modern.
    *   **Responsive Design:** The web app must be fully responsive and work seamlessly across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

*   **4.2. Screen 1: Mood Logging (Home Screen)**
    *   **Purpose:** The primary screen for daily mood check-ins.
    *   **Header:**
        *   Dynamic prompt: "How are you feeling today?"
        *   Current Date (e.g., "Thursday, June 20, 2025").
    *   **Mood Selector (Central Element):**
        *   A prominent, horizontally scrollable or tap-to-select row of 5-7 distinct mood options.
        *   **Visuals:**
            *   **Option A (Preferred):** Expressive, high-quality emojis (e.g., very sad, sad, neutral, happy, very happy).
            *   **Option B:** A color gradient representing mood (e.g., deep blue for sad, light blue, grey, light green, bright green/yellow for happy).
        *   **Interaction:** Tapping an emoji/color selects it. The selected option should be clearly highlighted (e.g., larger size, border, subtle animation).
    *   **Optional Tag Input:**
        *   Below the mood selector, a subtle text field: "What influenced your mood? (e.g., #work, #sleep, #friends)"
        *   Placeholder text should guide the user.
        *   As the user types, the app should suggest previously used tags for quick selection.
    *   **Action Button:**
        *   A clear, prominent button at the bottom: "Log Mood" or "Save".
        *   This button should only become active (e.g., change color, enable) once a mood has been selected.
    *   **Initial State:** When no mood has been logged for the current day, the mood selector should be prominent, inviting interaction.

*   **4.3. Screen 2: History (Calendar View)**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a quick, visual overview of past mood entries.
    *   **Header:**
        *   Current Month & Year (e.g., "June 2025").
        *   Left/Right arrows to navigate to previous/next months.
    *   **Calendar Grid:**
        *   Standard monthly calendar layout (7 columns for days of the week, rows for dates).
        *   Each day in the grid should display a small, subtle indicator of the logged mood for that day.
        *   **Indicator Options:**
            *   A small version of the chosen emoji.
            *   A small colored dot or square representing the mood's color.
        *   Days without a logged mood should be visually distinct (e.g., empty, greyed out).
        *   **Interaction:** Tapping a specific day should display the logged mood and any associated tags for that day in a small, non-intrusive pop-up or overlay. This pop-up should be dismissible.

*   **4.4. Screen 3: Insights (Graphs & Patterns)**
    *   **Purpose:** To visualize mood trends and basic correlations.
    *   **Header:**
        *   "Your Mood Insights"
        *   Timeframe Selector: Simple toggle buttons or a dropdown for "Last 7 Days", "Last 30 Days", "All Time".
    *   **Graph Area 1: Mood Over Time:**
        *   A simple line graph showing the average mood trend over the selected timeframe.
        *   Y-axis: Represents the mood scale (e.g., 1-5, or Bad to Good).
        *   X-axis: Represents dates.
        *   The line should be smooth and visually appealing.
    *   **Graph Area 2: Mood Frequency:**
        *   A simple bar chart showing how often each distinct mood (e.g., "Very Happy", "Happy", "Neutral", "Sad", "Very Sad") has been logged within the selected timeframe.
        *   Bars should be colored according to the mood's associated color.
    *   **Basic Tag Correlation:**
        *   A section titled "Common Influences" or "Mood Triggers".
        *   This section should list the most frequently used tags.
        *   Next to each tag, display a small visual indicator (e.g., a small colored dot or emoji) representing the *average mood* associated with that tag. For example, if #workstress is often logged with "sad" moods, a "sad" emoji or corresponding color should appear next to it. This provides a basic, at-a-glance correlation.

*   **4.5. Screen 4: Settings**
    *   **Purpose:** For app customization and management.
    *   **Header:** "Settings"
    *   **Sections/Options:**
        *   **"Customize Mood Scale":**
            *   Option to edit the text labels for each mood level (e.g., change "Neutral" to "Okay").
            *   Option to adjust the colors associated with each mood (if using a color scale).
        *   **"Reminders":**
            *   Toggle switch: "Daily Mood Reminder" (On/Off).
            *   If On: A time picker to set the specific time for the daily reminder. (Implementation via browser push notifications will require user permission).
        *   **"Export Data":**
            *   Button: "Export My Mood Data".
            *   Upon tap, trigger an export of the user's mood data (e.g., as a CSV file) to their device.
        *   **"About:**
            *   Displays app version number.
            *   Links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (these will be provided below).
            *   Credits (optional).

*   **4.6. Navigation:**
    *   A persistent bottom navigation bar across all main screens (for mobile view) or a sidebar/top navigation (for desktop view, responsive design).
    *   Icons for: **Home (Mood Logging)**, **History (Calendar)**, **Insights (Graphs)**, **Settings**.
    *   The currently active screen's icon should be highlighted.

## 5. Technical Requirements (Web App)

*   **5.1. Platform:** Web Application (accessible via any modern web browser).
*   **5.2. Technology Stack (Suggestions):**
    *   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
        *   **Frameworks (Optional but Recommended):** React, Vue.js, Svelte, or Angular for structured development and component reusability.
    *   **Styling:** CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules, or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Build Tools:** Webpack, Vite, or Parcel.
*   **5.3. Data Storage:**
    *   **Local Browser Storage:** All user mood data will be stored locally within the user's browser.
    *   **Recommended:** IndexedDB for structured data storage, or LocalStorage/SessionStorage for simpler key-value pairs.
    *   **No Server-Side Database:** No user mood data will be stored on any external servers.
*   **5.4. Backend Considerations (for V1):**
    *   **None Required:** Version 1 will operate entirely client-side. No server-side backend is needed for core functionality.
*   **5.5. Progressive Web App (PWA) Features (Recommended):**
    *   **Service Worker:** For offline capabilities and faster loading.
    *   **Web App Manifest:** To allow users to "install" the app to their home screen, providing a more native-like experience.
    *   **Push Notifications API:** For implementing reminders (requires user permission).
*   **5.6. Analytics:**
    *   **Client-Side Analytics:** Integrate a third-party analytics SDK (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude) to collect anonymous usage data.
    *   **User Consent:** Implement a clear consent mechanism for anonymous data collection on first app load, with an opt-out option.
    *   **Data Collected (Anonymous):** App launches/sessions, screen views, core actions (e.g., "mood logged" event without the mood value, "tag added," "export data clicked," "reminder set"), user flow, device/browser information, crash reports. **No PII will be collected.**

## 6. Future Considerations (Version 2 - Paid Features)

While not part of Version 1, keeping these in mind can help with architectural decisions for scalability:

*   **Advanced AI-Powered Insights:** Predictive analytics, personalized recommendations based on mood patterns (would likely require a backend).
*   **Integrations:** With health APIs (if available for web), wearables (if they offer web APIs), environmental data (would require a backend).
*   **Guided Programs & Content Libraries:** Curated meditations, exercises, structured well-being programs (could be served from a CDN or simple backend).
*   **Advanced Reporting:** More detailed, customizable reports for professionals (could require a backend for complex processing).
*   **Cloud Sync & Backup:** Secure cloud storage for mood data across devices (definitely requires a backend).

## 7. Success Metrics (for Version 1)

*   **Unique Visitors:** Number of distinct users accessing the web app.
*   **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Percentage of users who open and log a mood daily.
*   **Retention Rate:** How many users return to the app after 1 week, 1 month, etc.
*   **Average Mood Logs per User:** How frequently users are engaging with the core logging feature.
*   **User Feedback:** Qualitative feedback on ease of use, value, and desired features.
*   **PWA Installation Rate:** How many users add the app to their home screen.
